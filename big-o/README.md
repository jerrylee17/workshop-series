# Big O Notation Workshop

This Jupyter Noteobook file and slide deck was made to help people better
understand how to calculate the Big O Notation of algorithms they'll 
interact with as well as create. By going through this workshop you will
hopefully come out having a better understanding of Big O Notation and be
better prepared for when it comes up in interviews or interview practice.
