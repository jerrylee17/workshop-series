1. Paste in the repo name `jerrylee17/workshop-series`
1. Navigate to the workshop that is being taught
1. Click on the `.ipynb` file.
1. Open the file with Binder, by clicking the 3 circles.

Done! The notebook should load shortly, where you can follow my tutorial.

# About the SCE Data Structures and Algorithms Workshop Series

This is the official github repository of the 
data structures and algorithms workshop series
in the SCE. Every workshop hosted will be in a 
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format and will be 
posted in this repository. 

## Purpose
It seems that data structures and algorithms is something
that the SJSU curriculum has been slow on teaching. This 
workshop series helps students get a jump start learning
it and equip them with the tools they need to make more 
efficient code.

## Summary
This is a series of workshops with different instructors. 
Every workshop in this series focuses on a specific data
structure or algorithm, with the exception of the first 
three. To keep the structure of this workshop series uniform, 
the workshops will be taught in python. 

## Topics to be covered
- Beginner Python
- Big O notation
- Lists / Linked Lists / Stacks / Queues
- Sorting
- Searching
- Sliding window algorithm
- Trees / Tries / Heaps
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
