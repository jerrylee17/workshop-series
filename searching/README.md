# Searching Workshop

This Jupyter Noteobook file will go over some searching functions, and how they
work. It will also briefly discuss binary search trees and singly-linked tricks.

## To run on your browser:
1. Go to [NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
2. Paste in the repo name `https://github.com/hsorathia/daalgsh/tree/master/searching`
3. Click on the `.ipynb` file.
4. Open the file with Binder, by clicking the 3 circles.
   - If the binder asks for a kernal, select Python 3, and click on "set kernel"

Done! The notebook should load shortly, where you can follow my tutorial.
