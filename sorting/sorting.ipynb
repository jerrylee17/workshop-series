    "# Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is an extremely crucial concept to grasp while going into technical interviews. These algorithms are tweaks of well-known algorithms and knowing them helps build an understanding of different ways we can manipulate our data input. Moreover, by sorting our data, we're able to format it into a way that helps us create a solution. For example, one question I was asked in an interview was to detect the maximum product that can be generated by an array of values (i.e. `arr = [-3, 0, 2, 1, 5, 3, -2]`) while also having a particular count of numbers I was supposed to include in my final solution (i.e. n =3 means I need to choose 3 numbers from arr to generate the maximum product). I could have brute forced this problem, but instead I decided to sort the array, then look for the numbers I was interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, For different data types and requirements, we might want to adopt different types of sorting methods. For example, if you knew that you were dealing strictly with numbers, you might want to use something like a count/radix sort. If you just wanted a reliable and fast sorting method, you might opt for Merge Sort. But, if you had some limitations in your space, you might opt for something in place like Quick Sort instead.\n",

It goes one by one through elements in an array, and aims to \"bubble\" them to their right position. By completing this process, it is able to sort an entire array.\n",

For example if we have the array `arr = [7, 2, 5, 1, 6]` and we decide choose the mid element (5) as our pivot, we would end up with `arr = [2, 1, 5, 7, 6]` and 5 would be in it's final position. \n",

    "Unlike the other sorts, there's a lot more that could go wrong with quicksort. No matter how you choose your pivot, there's always a possibility of choosing the smallest number in the highest index or the largest number in the lowest index. This is a problem because then the algorithm would have to then slowly move this number to the opposite side of the array. If this happens often enough, it can drive the run-time to be O(n^2)!\n",
