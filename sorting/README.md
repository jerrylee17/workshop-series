# Sorting Workshop

This Jupyter Noteobook file will go over several different sorting functions,
how they work, and how they're implemented.


## To run on your browser:
1. Go to [NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
2. Paste in the repo name `https://github.com/hsorathia/daalgsh/tree/master/sorting`
3. Click on the `.ipynb` file.
4. Open the file with Binder, by clicking the 3 circles.
   - If the binder asks for a kernal, select Python 3, and click on "set kernel"

Done! The notebook should load shortly, where you can follow my tutorial.
